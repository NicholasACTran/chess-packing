# Chess Packing in Clingo/ASP
## Problem Statement
Inspiration Problem that was posed [here](https://veniamin-ilmer.github.io/ship-city).
It can be restated as "Within a n x n chessboard, what is the maximum number of rooks that can be placed on the board, where each rook has a path off the board?" Similar statements can be constructed for the knight, bishop, and queen.
